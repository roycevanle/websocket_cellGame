Ryan's Suggestion
-Add a light-out mode for the square

Justin's Suggestion
-Make squares smaller as the timer gets smaller

TO DO ***
-Research on how to host servers
    -Probably digital ocean & docker
-Research making socketIO the address of our server when we have it. I.e. (socket = io(http://app.com))
-Check what happens when you post a null host in server.listen([port[, host[, backlog]]][, callback])
